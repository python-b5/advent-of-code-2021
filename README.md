# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2021

This repository contains my Python solutions for Advent of Code 2021.

I made this repository a little late, so my solutions for the first four days were uploaded all at once.

Each day's solution is split into two parts (they are often very similar, but will produce different output, corresponding to each part of the day's challenge).

The solutions require no dependencies, aside from the Python standard library.
